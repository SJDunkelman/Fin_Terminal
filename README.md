# Fin_Terminal

This project was originally intended to be an easy-to-use CLI interface for the FinnHub API, a useful data source when backtesting strategies or for research during my Financial Engineering Masters. Shortly after beginning this, FinnHub released their own library [finnhub-python](https://github.com/Finnhub-Stock-API/finnhub-python) that I believed for the most part made this work redundant. I may recontinue a similar project in the near future if I find a market data source that is underserved by FinnHub, which has excellent coverage.
